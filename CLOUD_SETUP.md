# ☁️ Cloud Storage Setup Guide

## Overview
Your FinanceHub Pro app now supports cloud storage using Supabase, providing:
- ✅ **Cross-device sync** (desktop, mobile, tablet)
- ✅ **Privacy protection** (each user has isolated data)
- ✅ **Offline support** (works without internet)
- ✅ **Automatic backup** (data never lost)
- ✅ **Free tier** (generous limits for personal use)

## 🔧 Setup Steps

### 1. Create Supabase Account
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Click "Start your project"
3. Sign up with GitHub or email
4. Create a new project

### 2. Get Your Credentials
1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Settings** → **API**
2. Copy your **Project URL** and **anon public key**
3. You'll need these for the next step

### 3. Create Database Table
In your Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to **SQL Editor**
2. Run this SQL command:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_data (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  data JSONB NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) for privacy
ALTER TABLE user_data ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy that only allows users to access their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own data" ON user_data
  FOR ALL USING (user_id = current_setting('app.user_id', true)::text);
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url_here
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

### 5. Deploy to Vercel
1. Push your changes to GitHub
2. In Vercel, add the environment variables:
   - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
3. Redeploy your app

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### How Privacy Works
- **Unique User IDs**: Each user gets a random, unique identifier
- **Data Isolation**: Users can only access their own data
- **No Personal Info**: User IDs are random, not tied to personal information
- **Local First**: Data is always saved locally first, then synced to cloud

### Security Features
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- ✅ Data encrypted in transit and at rest
- ✅ No shared data between users
- ✅ Automatic data isolation

## 📱 Mobile Access

Once set up, your data will automatically sync across:
- ✅ Desktop browsers
- ✅ Mobile browsers
- ✅ Tablets
- ✅ Any device with internet access

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If sync isn't working:
1. Check your Supabase credentials in `.env`
2. Verify the database table was created correctly
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure you're online

### If you want to start fresh:
1. Go to User Profile → Cloud Sync Status
2. Click "Clear All Data"
3. Your app will reset to default data

### If you want to backup manually:
1. Go to User Profile → Backup/Restore
2. Click "Export Backup"
3. Save the JSON file safely

## 🔄 Migration from Local Storage

3. Future loads: Data loads from cloud (if newer) or local storage

No data will be lost during this process!
